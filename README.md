# Simulation_for_Physical_Processes

This project simulates some physical processes by matlab. They may include processes in optics, mechanics, astronomy, thermo-dynamics and electrodynamics. This README is also a content of this project, you can read this .md file to check whether there are simulations you needed.

This project is continually updated but non-scheduled.
